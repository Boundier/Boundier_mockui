FINAL ENGINEERING PROMPT — Paste the whole block below into Replit AI (or any code-gen tool)

Build a polished, mobile-first, standalone mock demo app called "Boundier Demo" that illustrates Conscient Technology influence detection. This is a concept demo, not a production product. Everything must run client-side; no backend or external APIs. The demo must include:

- Home screen with a single CTA "Open Social Media".
- A fake Social Media app screen containing a vertical feed of mock posts (6–8 posts).
- A liquid-glass Analysis Sidebar inside the fake Social Media app (swipe/click to open).
- A Boundier Dashboard screen (the app dash) that displays aggregated results; the dashboard values must always match the live analysis state (shared LocalStorage-based store).
- Deterministic Conscient engine (rule-based) implemented in `/src/lib/conscientEngine.ts`.
- Full design system: Cooper Hewitt font only; colors limited to #000543 (primary), #0038FF (accent), white; liquid glass panels using backdrop-filter blur(12px). Provide reduced-transparency & reduced-motion fallbacks and high-contrast mode.

--- TECH STACK
- React + Vite + TypeScript (preferred)
- Tailwind CSS
- framer-motion
- Chart.js (or simple Canvas) for small charts
- LocalStorage for persistence

--- DESIGN SYSTEM (MUST FOLLOW)
- Typography: **Cooper Hewitt** only (import via CSS).
- Colors: primary `#000543`, accent `#0038FF`, text `white`. Only opacity variants allowed otherwise.
- Liquid glass: `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`; sample fills `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)` (light) and `rgba(0,5,67,0.32)` (dark); rounded corners `16px`; soft stroke highlight; smooth transitions `200-250ms`.
- All UI must be legible on blurred backgrounds; provide "High contrast" and "Reduce transparency" toggles.

--- APP FLOW & UX
1. **Home Screen**
   - Centered Boundier logo placeholder
   - Large CTA: **Open Social Media**
   - Small footer: "Demo only — data stays on this device."

2. **Social Media Screen (Fake app)**
   - Header: App title "Social — (mock)" + small "Open Dashboard" button.
   - Vertical scroll feed with **6 mock posts** (list provided below).
   - Right-edge visible in-app thin indicator (4–6px) — click/swipe-in opens the Analysis Sidebar.
   - Tapping any post also opens the Analysis Sidebar for that post.
   - The Analysis Sidebar must appear **inside** the fake Social Media screen (not an OS overlay), with liquid-glass visuals.

3. **Analysis Sidebar (inside fake Social app)**
   - Slides in from right with framer-motion animation (~220ms spring).
   - Width ~300px at 390px layout (adaptive).
   - Shows:
     - Post summary (title, time, mock thumbnail)
     - **Influence Vector**: fear, urgency, hype, authority, curiosity, visual_hype (numeric 0–1 + horizontal bars)
     - **Response Vector**: engagement, hesitation, fixation, clickbait_response (0–1)
     - One-line explanation for the top 2 scoring influence types (deterministic text)
     - "Apply to Dashboard" button (writes the event to the shared store) — also auto-sync on open
     - Close button
   - When the sidebar opens or a user interacts with a post, the Conscient engine runs on that post and writes an influence-response event to LocalStorage.

4. **Boundier Dashboard Screen (App Dash)**
   - Accessible via main nav or "Open Dashboard" button.
   - Shows aggregated values computed from the same LocalStorage store:
     - Current Vulnerability Profile (per-dimension EWMAs)
     - Pattern Graph (7-point sliding array) visualized as a small line chart
     - Session counts by influence type (top 3 listed)
   - The Dashboard must reflect, in real time, any analysis performed in the Social Media Screen (same underlying data model).

--- CONSCIENT ENGINE (implement in /src/lib/conscientEngine.ts)
Export functions:
- analyzePost(post) => returns { influenceVector, responseVector, explanation }
- updateVulnerabilityProfile(influenceVector, responseVector) => updates stored EWMA per dimension
- getPatternGraph() => returns 7-point sliding array
- getVulnerabilityProfile() => returns current EWMA profile
- resetData() => clear localStorage

Implement these deterministic rules (exact behavior):

Influence Vector calculation pseudo-rules:
- start values 0
- if title contains any of ["warn","danger","risk","ruin","experts warn"] => fear += 0.6
- if audioFlag.high_tension => fear += 0.2
- if thumbnail.expression === "shocked" => fear += 0.2
- urgency = 0; if title contains ["now","today","last","only","limited"] => urgency += 0.5; if punctuationIntensity >=1 or capsIntensity>=1 => urgency += 0.2; if thumbnail.saturation > 0.7 => urgency += 0.2
- hype = 0; if clickbaitWords.length>0 => hype += 0.6; if title includes ["you won't believe","shocking"] => hype += 0.2
- authority = 0; if title includes ["expert","study","research","survey","experts"] => authority += 0.5
- curiosity = 0; if title contains "?" or "..." or starts with "guess" etc => curiosity += 0.4
- visual_hype = clamp(thumbnail.saturation * 0.7 + (thumbnail.faces > 0 ? 0.1 : 0))
- After computing, clamp all to [0,1]

Response Vector calculation pseudo-rules:
- engagement = clamp(dwellTimeMs / 8000, 0,1)  // demo max dwell 8s
- hesitation = 0; if user taps then quickly scrolls (dwell <300ms) => 0.6; else small values
- fixation = 1 if user opens same post twice or dwellTime > 6000ms; else scaled
- clickbait_response = 1 if user clicks within 2s of first view; else 0

Vulnerability Profile:
- For each influence dimension: ewma_new = 0.15*responseValue + 0.85*ewma_old
- Store in localStorage under key 'boundier_profile'

Pattern Graph:
- Each event pushes a scalar intensity = sum(influenceVector)/numDimensions
- Maintain last 7 events; store under key 'boundier_pattern'

--- DATA FLOW & SYNC REQUIREMENT
- When Analysis Sidebar runs analyzePost(post) it must write the resulting event into LocalStorage events array (key: 'boundier_events'), update the vulnerability profile and pattern graph.
- Dashboard reads from 'boundier_profile' and 'boundier_pattern' and displays identical numbers.
- Provide an "Apply to Dashboard" button that forces analysis and immediate sync for demo clarity.

--- UI DETAILS
- All components use Cooper Hewitt font; load via CSS.
- Primary background uses #000543; accent UI elements use #0038FF.
- Text and icons use white on dark areas; ensure good contrast with blurred backgrounds.
- Panel open/close animations must be smooth and use framer-motion.
- Provide small haptic/vibration simulation on mobile (use Vibration API where available) when "Apply to Dashboard".
- Add small accessibility toggles on Home: "Reduce motion" and "Reduce transparency" that change CSS behavior.
